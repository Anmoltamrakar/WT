                <h1 align="center"> For sake of Sita</h1>
                <br>
                <p>For sake of sita is manwa based on nepal kumari system. This story has been done in novel and anime form. This story shows the strugles of a kumari love life. this was relesed on Jun 13, 2014 .The plot follows ; While volunteering in Nepal, a Korean medical student named Sangmin Han encounters the beautiful yet tragic Sita. Previously, she was a Kumari—a prepubescent girl worshipped as the vessel of a goddess. But she has since been forsaken as a Kumari, and cast out from society. Falling in love, they marry and move to Korea, but their blissful love is short-lived; Sita dies only a year later.Losing the woman dearest to him, Sangmin desperately begs the gods to bring Sita back.</p>
                <br>
                <p>  His prayers are answered but in exchange for a sacrifice, and he awakens in the streets of Nepal. However, something is amiss—his body has suddenly aged, and standing in front of him is a young Sita, with no memory of him.Through two lovers bound together by a destiny running deeper than it first appears, For the Sake of Sita is the story of Sita growing up as a Kumari, and Sangmin's tribulations in trying to avert her terrible fate.
